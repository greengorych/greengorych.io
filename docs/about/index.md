# About the site

This site was born out of a series of posts within a Reddit community dedicated to WSL and the realization that information about WSL lacked coherence, consistency, and sufficient depth.

The main goal is to create complete and understandable documentation about the WSL ecosystem: its configurations, commands, operational characteristics, and additional services such as `cloud-init` and Ubuntu Pro for WSL.

The site is a combination of a [blog][blog] and a [reference][reference]. The blog publishes reviews, instructions, and announcements on topics related to WSL and Linux. The reference section collects, organizes, and describes information about the WSL ecosystem.

The terms of use for the materials published on this site are described in the [Terms of Use][terms-of-use] section.

[reference]: ../reference/index.md
[terms-of-use]: terms-of-use.md
