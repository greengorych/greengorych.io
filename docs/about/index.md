# About the project

The project grew out of a series of posts in a Reddit community dedicated to WSL and from the realization that information about the WSL ecosystem is often fragmented, incomplete, occasionally inconsistent, and does not always answer the practical questions users have.

The primary goal of the project is to create clear and comprehensive documentation about the WSL ecosystem: its configurations, commands, behavioral characteristics, additional services, as well as related tools.

The project includes:

- [wsl-config][wsl-config] — a repository with ready-to-use WSL configuration templates.
- [Additional WSL distributions list][additional-wsl-distributions-list] — an unofficial list of WSL distributions that are not included in the official catalog.
- The website that consist of:
    - The [Blog][blog], featuring reviews, guides, and announcements related to WSL and Linux.
    - The [Reference][reference] section, which organizes and describes information about the WSL ecosystem.
    - The [Projects][projects] section, describing related initiatives and tools.
    - The About section, containing information about the project, the [Contributing guide][contributing-guide], [Terms of Use][terms-of-use], and the license texts: [CC BY-SA 4.0 license][license-cc-by-sa] for text content and [MIT license][license-mit] for code and configuration files.
